        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr class="centered-line">
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Hello! I'm Ellaine Herrera, a passionate and enthusiastic novice in the field of design. My journey began during my Junior High School years when I specialized in Information and Communication Technology and was introduced to Adobe Photoshop and InDesign.
            This early exposure led me to become the layout designer for our school publication. My involvement in graphic design continued into Senior High School, where I served as the layout artist for our school newspaper. During my college years, I took on part-time work, creating tarpaulins, invitations, and other designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am dedicated to continuous learning and improvement, always keen to explore new techniques and trends. In my work, I aim to create visually appealing and user-friendly designs that leave a lasting impression. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I have enjoyed creating it!

        <h3> Event-related Designs</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to my academic projects, I've gained a lot of hands-on experience through part-time work, creating custom tarpaulins and invitations for various events. This job has really helped me hone my graphic design skills and taught me the importance of meeting client expectations and deadlines. 
        These projects not only improved my technical abilities with design software but also taught me a lot about communicating with clients and managing projects.

        <h3> Mobile Mock Up Design</h3>
        <p>
            As an activity for a software engineering project, I designed a real-life gaming app that allows players to share their actions based on the tasks they choose. Once a task is completed, friends across the city can see the player's efforts to combat climate change and protect the environment. The app provides a platform for users to connect and collaborate in making their community a better place. 
            Players can also upload photos as proof of task completion and engage in chat conversations.

        <h3> Web design Mock Ups</h3>
        <p>
            As part of an assignment in my Software Engineering course, I created my first web design mock-up for a university website. 
            This project required us to design the essential elements of the site, including the landing page and the login page. 
            In addition to this, I developed a comprehensive UI design for my undergraduate thesis. This project involved creating a detailed mock-up that featured not only the landing page but also a preview of a specific data structure section, showcasing my ability to design user interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing.

        <p>
            Tarpaulin Design for Birthday Celebration. Designs are colorful and Joyful. Playful fonts are made to capture the celebratory spirit.
            Bright and cheerful colors to create a lively and inviting look. The design needed to reflect the festive atmosphere of the event while highlighting key details such as the date, time, and location.
